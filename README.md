# la-brisca-cli🕹️🖥️👨‍💻
This is a simulation of the classic game of "La Brisca" in command line interface, programmed with Java (build 14.0.2+12). Made by @ericmp33 with <3. ✔️

# What is "La Brisca"?💡
"La Brisca" is a popular cards game in a lot of mediterranean countries, such as Catalonia, Italy, France, Portugal, Croatia, Slovakia... Also is present in center and south America.

- For being able to play it and to understand how the game works🤔, it's aim and more information I recomend you to check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisca and also to search on the Internet.

- If you know catalan, keep calm, you can play in catalan😃! When the game starts it asks in which language you want to play (Catalan or English).

# Simple instructions📄
- ❗⚠️IMPORTANT⚠️❗ You should use a terminal that suports colorized ASCII characters, so you will see the prints colorized, and all will be more readable!

- To execute the game make sure you have a compatible version of Java (build 14.0.2+12). Then input `java -jar .\la-brisca-cli.jar` to the terminal, where `.` is the current folder, which contains the `jar`.

- The game can have multiple players, but in this case I chose the 2-players version. I created a bot, so you can play against it.

- When the game starts you'll be asked about 2 things. The gamemode and the bot's AI.

Gamemode:
> If u choose the default gamemode, you won't be able to see the cards of the bot. It's called default because in real life default's game mode you can't see oponents cards.

> Otherwise, if u choose the "hacker" mode you'll be able to see bot's in-hand cards and other information👀.

Bot's AI:

> If you enable it bot will be able to throw the cards "thinking" properly🧠. Otherwise will throw a random card🤖🤪.
