# la-brisca-cli🕹️🖥️👨‍💻
Welcome to the command line interface version of the classic board game of "La Brisca", programmed with Java 16. Made by <a href="https://github.com/ericmp33">@ericmp33</a>. ✔️

# What is "La Brisca"?💡
"La Brisca" is a popular cards game in a lot of Mediterranean countries, such as Catalonia, Italy, France, Portugal, Croatia, Slovakia... Also is present in Center and South America.

- For being able to play it and to understand how the game works🤔, it's aim and more information I recommend you to check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisca and also to search on the Internet.

- If you know Catalan, you can play in Catalan😃! When the game starts, it asks in which language you want to play.

# Simple instructions📄
- ❗⚠️IMPORTANT⚠️❗ You should use a terminal that supports colorized ASCII characters, so you will see the prints colorized and all will be more readable! If you are on Windows I recommend you <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701" target="_blank">the new Windows Terminal</a>.

- To execute the game <a href="https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot">get Java☕</a> - 16 or newer version. Then download the game <a href="https://github.com/ericmp33/la-brisca-cli/raw/main/out/artifacts/la_brisca_cli_jar/la-brisca-cli.jar">here</a>. Execute the file via terminal inputting `java -jar ./la-brisca-cli.jar`, where `.` is the current folder, which contains the `jar`.

- The game can have multiple players, but in this case I chose the 2-players version. I created a bot, so you can play against it.

- When the game starts, you'll be asked about 2 things. The gamemode and the bot's AI.

Gamemode:
> If u choose the default gamemode, you won't be able to see the cards of the bot. Default mode acts like real life default's game mode, where you can't see opponents cards.

> Otherwise, if u choose the "hacker" mode, you'll be able to see bot's in-hand cards and other information👀.

Bot's AI:

> If you enable it, the bot will be able to throw the cards "thinking" properly🧠. Otherwise, it will throw a random card🤖🤪.
